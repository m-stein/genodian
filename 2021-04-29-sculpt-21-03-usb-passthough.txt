                   USB stick passthrough in Sculpt 21.03

Recently, I wanted to use an USB stick in my Linux VM in Sculpt 21.03 and I
couldn't figure out anymore how to do it. I was surprised that I struggled to
find information on this topic and so I wrote this short tutorial in order to
make it easier for others.

In Sculpt, you can show a list of detected USB devices in the Leitzentrale
Component view - the first one you are presented with when starting the system
that shows the running programs in a graph. In this graph, click on the
"ram_fs" node and then on the "Inspect" button that just showed up. This will
add another button "Inspect" in the center of the top of the screen.

Clicking on this new "Inspect" button at the top will toggle the Leitzentrale
to a terminal prompt:

! inspect:/>

In this prompt, open the file _reports/drivers/usb_devices_ by typing:

! vim reports/drivers/usb_devices

A list in form of XML _<device>_ tags, one per detected USB device, shows up.
Now, take a short look at the beginning of the list, insert your USB stick,
close vim ({Esc}:q{Enter}) and open the file again. The first _<device>_ tag
should have changed - this is your USB stick:

! <devices>
!    <device label="..." ...>
!       <interface class="..."/>
!    </device>
!    ...
! <devices>

Now, open the file _config/launcher/usb_devices_rom_ in the same vim instance
({Ctrl+w}{Ctrl+n}{Esc}:e config/launcher/usb_devices_rom{Enter}). This is the
configuration of the program that controls which USB devices will be known to
your virtual machine. You have to copy the whole _<device>_ tag of your USB
stick from the _usb_devices_ file to the _<inline>_ tag in the
_usb_devices_rom_ file:

! <launcher ...>
!    <config>
!       <output ...>
!          <inline>
!             <device label="..." ...>
!                <interface class="..."/>
!             </device>
!          </inline>
!       </output>
!    </config>
! </launcher>

Therefore, in vim, first go to the former file ({Ctrl+w}{Down}), navigate to
the last character of _</device>_, start a selection ({Esc}v), navigate
to the first character of _<device>_ and copy the selection (y), go to the
second file ({Ctrl+w}{Up}), navigate to the last character of _<inline>_, add
a new line ({Esc}o) and paste the copied text ({Esc}p). Finally, safe the file
and quit vim ({Esc}:wqa{Enter}).

You can now go back to the "Components" view of the Leitzentrale, start an
instance of _usb_devices_rom_ (directly in the "+" menu) and your Virtualbox 5
VM as usual. Take care to route the ROM session "usb devices" required by the
VM to _usb_devices_rom_.

By the way, you can do all this as well while the VM and _usb_devices_rom_ are
already running. The programs will react to the change without the need to
restart them. So, you can plug in and out USB sticks through the file
_config/launcher/usb_devices_rom_ at any time.

One last advice: You cannot inspect a USB stick in the Leitzentrale while
having it passed-through to a VM! Clicking the "Inspect" button in the "USB"
dialog in the "Component" view while using passthrough will render your
"Inspect" view unresponsive.  However, if this occured to you for any reason,
you can reset the "Inspect" view by subsequently clicking the "Inspect" button
in the dialog of another storage device.
