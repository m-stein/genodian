                The S채ntis System Summit in Summer 2019

I must admit that I more or less stumbled into this wonderful event by chance.
Not knowing what to expect exactly from the online presentation I was totally
overwhelmed by the positive experience in the end. Not only provided the
location at mountain S채ntis in Appenzell a breathtaking scenery and the hotel
was great, but, most of all, amongst all organizers and participants there was
an enthusiastic, open-minded and relaxing atmosphere that made this
(un)conference special to me.

Also very refreshing was the concept of the conference: The organizers decided
not to enforce a pre-defined schedule of talks and presentations but to
encourage everyone to participate in assembling a schedule of discussion
rounds about desired topics ad-hoc. This turned out to be, at least to me, a
very dynamic and inspiring solution. I had some interesting discussions about
the Genode framework, Sculpt and my recent work with Ada and SPARK but also
about cryptographics.

On top of that, we had a fascinating trip to the windy summit of mount S채ntis
were a surprise tour through the inner workings of the S채ntis transmission
tower and weather station waited for us. I definitely hope for a successor of
this gathering and, so far, like to thank all those guys who made this happen!
