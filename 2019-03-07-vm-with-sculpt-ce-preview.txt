            How to start my VM with the new Sculpt-CE preview

Things have changed a bit with the revised software deployment in the recently
published
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/19.02#Sculpt_OS_as_a_community_experience__CE_ - preview of Sculpt CE].
No matter wether you are updating from Sculpt VC and have installed your VM
following the
[https://genode.org/documentation/articles/sculpt-vc - Sculpt-VC documentation]
or whether you downloaded a fresh Debian with the Sculpt-CE preview - this
brief walk-through might help you getting it to run (again). Of course, once
Sculpt CE gets released, the added documentation will explain things way more
comprehensive.

Until then, the following approach - using the themed window manager - might
be the easiest way to get along:

# After Sculpt came up, connect to the network on the left-hand panel. This
  is needed to install software.

# In the '+' menu in the middle, go to "Depot... -> genodelabs -> GUI...",
  select the "themed wm", and install it. Wait until the download at the left
  side is finished.

# In the menu in the middle a routing dialog for the themed WM pops up.
  Use it to connect the themed WM as follows

  * GUI (focus)  -> keyboard focus
  * GUI          -> system GUI server
  * Report       -> system reports

  After now clicking "Add component", the component graph in the middle
  should show the themed WM running.

# For a quick test that the themed WM is running properly, you may
  start "Depot... -> genodelabs -> Demos... -> nano3d" with the
  following connection:

  * GUI -> themed wm

  You should now see a spinning 3D shape in a window. After switching to the
  runtime view by pressing F12, you should be able to move the window around.
  Switch back to the Leitzentrale view using again the F12 key.

# Start the 'vm_fs' component by clicking on the corresponding launcher
  at the top level of the '+' menu. This is a chroot instance that provides
  the VM directory (<sculpt-partition>/vm/debian) as a file system.

# Start the 'shared_fs' component analogously to the VM FS. This chroot
  instance provides the shared directory (<sculpt-partition>/shared/) as a
  file system.

# Start the 'usb_devices_rom' component from the '+' menu, which can
  be used to assign USB devices to the VM.

# Now you can add the VM by selecting
  "Depot... -> genodelabs -> Virtual machines... -> vbox5-nova-sculpt". Again,
  a routing dialog pops up. Use it to connect the VM as follows:

  * File system (vm)     -> vm fs
  * File system (shared) -> shared fs
  * GUI                  -> themed wm
  * Network              -> nic router
  * ROM (capslock)       -> global capslock state
  * ROM (platform info)  -> platform information
  * ROM (usb devices)    -> usb devices rom
  * Report (shape)       -> themed wm
  * Report               -> system reports
  * Region maps          -> custom virtual memory objects
  * Real-time clock      -> system clock
  * USB                  -> direct USB device access

Now the familiar virtual-machine window should come up in the runtime view.
