               The CBE series #4 - Video "A Linux VM on a CBE device"

There is now an online video of the tutorial
[http://genodians.org/m-stein/2020-06-12-cbe-linux-vm - "The CBE series #3 - A Linux VM on a CBE device"]
available on
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UDo7sf-14E - Youtube]. It goes through the
whole tutorial starting with a fresh Sculpt 20.02 installation until the
rekeying of the CBE device while rebooting the Linux VM on top of it.


The CBE series
--------------

This series of articles describes the features and integration of the
Consistent Block Encrypter (CBE) in detail. The CBE is a block-device
encryption component with its core logic entirely written in SPARK. It combines
multiple techniques to ensure confidentiality, integrity, consistency, and
freshness of the block data efficiently. Furthermore, the whole core logic so
far passes gnatprove in mode "flow".

In case you are not familiar with the basic structure of the CBE, I'd recommend
you this introduction before reading on:

Note that the above branches are not the ones used for the packages in this
tutorial. They mark the CBE mainline based on most recent Genode 20.05 while
the packages in this tutorial had to be built for Genode 20.02 to be compatible
with the most recent Sculpt version.
