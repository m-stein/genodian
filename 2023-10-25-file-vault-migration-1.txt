            Migration of incompatible File Vault containers

The [https://genodians.org/m-stein/2021-05-17-introducing-the-file-vault - File Vault]
is a graphical tool for creating and managing encrypted file
containers in Genode. The first official version was published with Sculpt
21.03b. Since then, the File Vault is part of the basic tooling for Sculpt.

The File Vault in Sculpt 23.10 is the first one not to be backwards-compatible.
So, containers created with File Vault 23.04 or earlier are not accessible with
File Vault 23.10. However, attempting to open an older container with File
Vault 23.10 doesn't do harm to the container.

In order to allow for a smooth transition, Sculpt 23.10 provides a migration
approach for File Vault users. The idea is to use a forward-port of the old
File Vault to decrypt all files and then copy them to a new File Vault 23.10
container.

For this tutorial, I assume that you are using the recall_fs package as file
system server for the 'data' and 'trust_anchor' sessions of your File Vault.
First, install and deploy '+ -> genodelabs -> tools -> system_shell' with the
the 'target' File System routed to the File System that recall_fs uses and do

! mv rw/recall/file_vault rw/recall/file_vault_23_04

Then, you'll need my package index. You can download it via
'+ -> depot -> selection -> mstein'. Now, install and deploy the
'+ -> depot -> mstein -> file_vault_23_04' package and route its 'data' file
system to the old File Vault container. It's fine if your container is older
than 23.04, as version 23.04 was fully backwards-compatible.

As soon as you have unlocked your old container in File Vault 23.04 by entering
the passphrase, look up its Client FS dimensions. Install and deploy
'+ -> depot -> genodelabs -> tools -> file_vault' package and create a new
container with an equally sized or bigger Client FS. Leave both, the old and
the new File Vault running and unlocked.

Next, deploy the '+ -> genodelabs -> tools -> system_shell' package a second
time but this time route the 'report' FS to file_vault_23_04 and the
'config' FS to file_vault. The 'target' FS route is not important. Inside this
second shell, do

! cp -rfv report/* config/

After that, the content of both File Vault containers should be identical and
the new container should integrate into your system without further ado. You
can now close file_vault_23_04 and the two system_shell instances. Just to be
sure, I'd advice you to keep your old container as back up for a while. In
general, it is advisable to not store critical data in the File Vault yet or at
least have a differently secured back-up as the File Vault project is still
quite in flux.
