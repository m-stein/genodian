                      About the CBE design approach

In this article, I'd like to document the design approach applied in the CBE
because I find it particularly interesting and elegant in some ways. Although
the article was motivated through my work at the CBE project, I didn't add it
to the CBE article series because the concept is not CBE specific and, in fact,
existed in great part already before the CBE with projects like Genode's VFS
and propably even earlier in other systems that I don't know. So, please don't
take this as a claim for the concept to be my idea - I just want to document
it ;)

Advantages

Disadvantages

* Finding a solution for a problem that fits well into the described concept
  was sometimes the contrary of "straight forward" for me. I had to get used to
  it - but the result is worth it.

* The design might produce a notable amount of bureaucratic code. However,
  this bureaucracy consists of only a handful of very basic things that are
  repeated very often. Creating a generic framework for this might be worth
  further investigation.
